# SQLite-automation
This is for working with SQLite with python automation

## Notes 

### for download SQLite use this URL : https://sqlitebrowser.org
### for understand this practice i used : https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html

## when we use SQLite app , and open a new DataBase we will mark : 

* `NN, NotNull:` means that you have to add a value and you can't skip this, you will have to put username and password but you dont have to put notes. 
* `U, Unique:` it will be a uniqe value , so we cant put the same username but password or notes i dont care.
* `PK primery key , AI auto incremant:` means that this column will jump and update in one eaceh time.
